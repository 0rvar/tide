## Installing for Developers

The `tide_install` function offers a few flags. `-d` will install Tide as a developer which provides extra files for testing. `-l` will install Tide from a local directory. When installing remotely, `tide_install` takes a branch name as an argument, defaulting to master.

Examples:

```fish
tide_install -d example-branch
```

```fish
tide_install -ld ~/tide
```

## Testing

The `tide_test` command runs tests from the `$__fish_config_dir/tests` folder using [fishtape][]. Currently there are unit tests for most prompt items.

Example:

```fish
tide_test status
```
