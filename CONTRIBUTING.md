## Testing

The `tide test` command runs tests from the `$_tide_dir/tests` folder using [fishtape][]. Currently there are unit tests for most prompt items. You can quickly install fisher and fishtape using `tide test -i`

Example:

```console
tide test status
```

You can run all tests with the `-a` flag.

```console
tide test -a
```
